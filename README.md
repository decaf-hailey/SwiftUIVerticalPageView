## What's for
To use vertical PageView,

customizing native (horizontal) PageView was not a good choice for caring about ignoring safearea.

It has only one file but many cases were considered.

It would be used often, because designers like this style very much.

Please open Example and enjoy it!


## Example
To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.
